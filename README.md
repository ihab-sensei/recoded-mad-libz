# Re:Coded Mad Libz

## What is Mad Libs?

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs). Yes, I know this section is short, do not skip this, **please read what Mad Libs is or the rest of this will make no sense**. In normal mad libs, you usually just insert the word, but in this version, it's more like a "fill in the blank" of an existing story.

## Technologies used:
We used javascript with regular expressions and bootstrap 5. The website is fully responive.
